<h1> Hello World</h1>
<p>Hello world this is Ruby Rabelle Rouser, I am bringing you my very first web page, evah!  (LOL, no not really evah! but in quite a while)
Lets make a list of my many skills:</p>
<ul>My list of skills:
	<li>HTML - been doing HTML since 1996! (and was teaching it by 1998) woo-hoo</li> 
<!-- do we really have to close the li tags in HTML 5?? got to find out! -->
	<li>CSS - early skeptic of CSS but came to tolerate it</li>
	<li>Javascript - verboten in my early web development days, and then I spent all day doing it... kinda fun</li>
	<li>ASP - (ummmm  2.0, is that even a thing anymore?) didn't love asp enough to pursue .net(yet)</li>
	<li>SQL - mama loves SQL.. and databases in general.. this may make me an extra-dork, but I guess I will live with it, triggers anyone?</li>
	<li>C++ - three semesters of racking my brain with C++ taught me a good bit about programming fundamentals, but didn't really help with web development in 2005.</li>
	<li>Photoshop - my second love</li>
	<li>AJAX - Asyncronous Javascript and XML - used it to make my front end coding do cool things without a page refresh</li>
	<li>XML - yeah, okay, took a class on it, and I get how it's used, but it's not my favorite</li>
	<li>Ruby - SkillCrush baby! </li>
	<li>Git & Github - well I wouldn't be here if it wasn't on the menu!</li>
